 7. Rice (Oryza sativa L. or Oryza glaberrima) 
 
Rice is the seed of the monocot plants. As a cereal grain, it is the most 
important staple food for a large part of the world's human population, 
especially in East and South Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and 
the West Indies. It is the grain with the second-highest worldwide
production, after maize (corn). 
 
Since a large portion of maize crops are grown for purposes other than 
human consumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to 
human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one fifth of the 
calories consumed worldwide by the human species. As a traditional 
food plant in Africa, its cultivation declined in colonial times, but its 
production has the potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, 
and foster rural development and support sustainable land care. 
 
Rice is an annual short day cereal crop (even though some varieties are 
long day) and grown widely in tropical countries; it needs about 1,800 
mm of precipitation annually. At national level, during 2019/20 
cropping season 57,575.72 ha of land is covered by this crop with a 
total yield estimate of about 1,706,301.01qt. The highest yield is 
obtained in warm temperature and soil with high clay silt content. 
Seeds are sown in nurseries at the rate of 60 kg/ha and transplanted to 
the field 4-6 plants per hill when seedlings are well grown. It needs 90-
200 days to mature depending on varieties. 
 
It is a recently introduced cereal crop into Ethiopia and cultivated in 
Fogera (South Gondar), Pawe (Northwestern part of Ethiopia), 
Gambela and Southeastern part of the country (irrigated rice).It is also 
produced in western parts in a small scale. There is lots of potential rice 
producing areas in Ethiopia.

  8. Maize (Zea mays L.) 
 
Maize originated in Central America and was introduced to West 
Africa in the early 1500 A.D by the Portuguese traders. It was 
introduced to Ethiopia in 16th or 17th century. Today maize is one of the 
most important food crops worldwide. It is grown in most parts of the 
world over a wide range of environmental conditions, ranging between 
500 latitude north and south of equator. It also grows from sea level to 
over 3000 meters above sea level. 
 
In Ethiopia, maize grows from moisture stress areas to high rainfall 
areas and from lowlands to the highlands.  It is largely produced in 
Western, Central, Southern and Eastern parts of the country. In 2019/20 
cropping season 2,274,305.93 hectares of land was covered with maize 
with an estimated production not less than 96,357,345.00 quintals. 
 
In our country maize is produced mainly for food, especially, in major 
maize producing regions particularly for low-income groups, it is also 
used as staple food.  Maize is consumed as ''Injera'' Porridge, Bread and 
''Nefro.''  It is also consumed roasted or boiled as vegetables at green 
stage.  In addition to the above, it is used to prepare local alcoholic 
drinks known as ''Tella'' and ''Arekie.''  The leaf and stalk are used for 
animal feed and also dried stalk & cob are used for fuel. It is also used 
as industrial raw material for oil & glucose production.

 9. Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) 
 
S. bicolor is the cultivated species of sorghum; its wild relatives make 
up the botanical genus Sorghum. It is cultivated for its edible grain. 
Sorghum originated in northern Africa, and is now cultivated widely in 
tropical and subtropical regions. S. bicolor is typically an annual, but
some cultivars are perennial. It grows in clumps that may reach over 4 
meters high. The grain is small, ranging from 3 to 4 mm in diameter. 
Sweet sorghums are sorghum cultivars that are primarily grown for 
foliage; they are shorter than those grown for grain.  
 
The species can grow in arid soils and withstand prolonged droughts. It 
has four features which make it one of the most drought resistant crops 
of all i.e., i) it has a very large root-to-leaf surface area ii) in times of 
drought it will roll its leaves to lessen water-loss by transpiration iii) if 
drought continues, it will go into dormancy rather than dying and iv) its 
leaves are protected by a waxy cuticle. 
 
Sorghum is one of the major crops produced in Ethiopia, and it is the 
fourth important crop in terms of area coverage and volume of 
production.  It is adapted to a wide range of environment, and hence 
can be produced in the high lands, medium altitude and low land areas.  
It is widely produced more than any other crops, in the areas where 
there is moisture stress.  In 2019/20 cropping season, sorghum is 
produced on about 1,828,182.49 ha of land from which 52,655,800.59 
quintals of yield are obtained.    
 
Sorghum is used in various ways in our country.  The grains are used 
for human foods such as Porridge, “Nefro,” infant food, syrup, and 
local beverages known as “Tella‟‟ and “Arekie‟‟.  Also the leaf and 
stalk are used for animal feed and further the stalks are also used for 
construction of houses and fences, and as fuel wood.

 13. Food barley (Hordeum vulgare) 
 
Barley belongs to the genus Hordeum L. in the tribe Triticeae of the 
family Poaceae. The earliest cultivation of barley is believed to have 
begun some 8,000 to 10,000 years ago in the area of the Middle East 
known as the Fertile Crescent. The crop is now grown worldwide with 
greater concentration in temperate areas and high altitudes of the 
tropics and subtropics. The greatest diversity of barley in terms of 
morphological types, genetic races, disease-resistant lines, and endemic 
morphotypes exists in Ethiopia. 
 
Barley has been produced in Ethiopia, since ancient times. Barley is 
one of the most important staple food crops in the highlands of 
Ethiopia.  It has great importance in social and food habit of the people. 
Both food and malting barley are produced in the country. At the 
national level in 2019/20 cropping season, 950,742.01 ha of land is 
covered by food and malt barley and over 23,780,102.92 quintals are 
produced. It is used to prepare various types of food and local and 
industrial beverages.  
 
Barley is cropped twice a year. The main season, locally known as 
Meher, relies on June to September rainfall. The major barley 
producing regions are Oromiya, Amhara, Tigray, and Southern 
Nations, which account for about 99.5% of the total annual barley 
production. Currently, barley grain is used for the preparation of 
different foodstuffs, such as injera, porridge, kolo, and local drinks, 
such as tela, horde, and beer. The straw is used as animal feed, 
especially during the dry season. It is also useful for thatching roofs 
and as bedding.

 14. Malt barley (Hordeum distichon.) 
 
Malt barley is characterized as two-rowed and six rowed barley in 
which only the middle spiklet of each three produces seed, the other 
two being sterile or male. Malt is the major (90%) raw material for beer 
production. Modern malting in Ethiopia started in 1974 at St. George 
brewery. Assela Malt factory was established in 1984 with the aim of 
supplying malt to local breweries.  
 
Malting is a process in which the grain is germinated and the very 
young seedlings are then dried to produce malt for brewing beer. Malt 
contains enzymes, which converts starch to fermentable sugars. A by-
product of brewing is yeast, which is used in baking and for the 
production of vitamin-rich yeast extracts. 
 
Arsi and Bale are the major producing regions of malt barley. 
Highlands of Shewa and similar areas are also producing larger 
quantities of malt barley.  As the crop has been cultivated since ancient 
times many types of varieties are produced in our country. Malt barley 
has double purposes in Ethiopia; it is used for food (bread, and several 
traditional dishes) and also for malting. Consequently, there are 
different competing alternative channels for the crop making it 
sustainable source of income for smallholder farmers in the country.

 4. Chickpea (Cicer arietinum)Chickpea was first produced in the Middle East about 7, 000 years ago.
At present, it is produced in over 40 countries represented in all
continents. However, the most important chickpea producing countries
are India, Turkey, Pakistan, Iran, Mexico, Australia, Ethiopia,
Myanmar, and Canada. About 95% of chickpea cultivation and
consumption is in the developing countries. In Ethiopia, the earliest
finding of chickpea is reported in 1520 BC. Ethiopia is the largest
producer of chickpea in Africa accounting for about 46% of the
continent‟s production during 1994-2006. It is also the seventh largest
producer worldwide and contributes about 2% to the total world
chickpea productionThere are two types of chickpea produced globally, namely desi and
kabuli chickpeas. Kabuli chickpeas have a larger cream-colored seed
with a thin seed coat whereas the desi type has a smaller, reddish
brown-colored seed with a thick seed coat. On average, world
production consists of about 75% of desi and 25% of kabuli types.
Although Kabuli types can be profitably adapted in the country,
Ethiopia traditionally produces largely the desi types. Morphologically,
desi types have pink flowers while the Kabuli types are characterized
by white flowers. It is grown at the end of the main rainy season using
residual soil moisture. This allows farmers to practice double cropping,
which in turn increases productivity of scarce land resource and serves
as an additional source of income.Chickpea is one of the major highland pulse crop widely grown in the
highland and semi-highland regions of Ethiopia mainly on clay soil and
fixes atmospheric nitrogen in soils and thus improves soil fertility and
saves fertilizer costs in subsequent crops. In 2019/20 cropping season,
208,837.91 hectares of land was covered with chickpea and the
production was estimated at about 4,351,932.14 quintals. Because of its
multiple importances, the crop is widely produced by the Ethiopian
farmers.  Chickpea is widely used for food for its high protein content.
Apart from this, because of its ability to fix nitrogen it is used in crop
rotation with the nationally important cereal crops like wheat, tef and
barley.   _____________                                  Crop Variety Register

 5. Cowpea (Vigna ungulculata.)

Cowpea has been cultivated for many centuries in the developing world
and well adapted to the stressful growing condition of the tropics and
has excellent nutritional qualities. It is a grain legume, which can be
grown in relatively infertile sandy soils with a minimum annual rainfall
of 200mm. It is a fast growing, drought resistant crop, which also
improves soil fertility by fixing atmospheric nitrogen. Cowpea grain
typically contains 230-250g/kg crude protein (CP) and 500-670 g/kg
starch on a dry matter (DM) basis and cowpea forage, i.e. the crop
residue after harvesting grain, 210g CP and 600g digestible dry matter
per kg DM.

The forage is used as a ruminant feed by smallholder farmers in West
Africa, Asia and South America and therefore offers potential for use
in the drier regions of Ethiopia. Under such conditions cowpea forage
is usually superior to other forage legumes in terms of both quantity
and quality. Cowpea crop is grown as a green manure and also a cover
crop to increase soil fertility, retain moisture and reduce soil erosion.

Cowpea is primarily used in the form of dry seed cooked as a pulse in a
large variety of dishes.  Green beans or cut green pods used as a
vegetable are of secondary importance.  In some areas of semi humid
tropics the cowpea provides more than half the plant protein in human
diets. Sometimes cowpea is also grown for forage and as a cover crop.

 8. Soybean (Glycine max)

Soybean (U.S.) or soya bean (UK) (Glycine max) is a species of
legume native to East Asia. The plant is classed as an oilseed and
pulse. Fat-free (defatted) soybean meal is a primary, low-cost, source
of protein for animal feeds and most prepackaged meals; soy vegetable
oil is another valuable product of processing the soybean crop.
Soybeans can produce at least twice as much protein per hectare as any
other major vegetable or grain crop, 5 to 10 times more protein per acre
than land set aside for grazing animals to make milk, and up to 15
times more protein per acre than land set aside for meat production

Soybean is an internationally known important pulse crop. It is used for
different purposes. In the 2019/20 cropping season, this crop covers
about 54,543.26 hectares of land with an estimated production not less
than 1,256,232.03 quintals. Since the oil content is high (16% and
above) it is used for edible oil production. The by-product is cheap and
an important source of protein for both human consumption & animal
feed. It can also be used as Soya milk and Soya meat.

In Ethiopia FAFA Food Factory has imported and used soybeans to
prepare balanced food for infants and adults. Recently the factory is
trying to improve the food value of other food types by mixing with
Soya bean flour. This indicates that the importance of Soybean in the
market is increasing gradually.

 6. Sunflower (Helianthus annuus)

Sunflower is native to the Central America. The evidence thus far is
that it was first domesticated in Mesoamerica, present day Mexico,
about 2600 BC. Sunflower belongs to the family Compositae. It is an
annual, erect and an herbaceous plant growing to a height of 1.5 to 6.0
meters. The crop requires a cool climate during germination and
seedling growth. Seedlings tolerate frosts moderately well until they
reach the four to six leaf stage of development. Sunflower can be
grown on a wide range of soils and tolerates a moderate pH range and
some salinity.

Sunflower oil, extracted from the seeds, is used for cooking, as carrier
oil and to produce margarine and bio-diesel, as it is cheaper than olive
oil. A range of sunflower varieties exist with differing fatty acid
compositions; some 'high oleic' types contain a higher level of healthy
monounsaturated fats in their oil than even olive oil. Sunflower oil is
also a rich source (64%) of linoleic acid, which helps in washing out
cholesterol deposition in the coronary arteries of the heart and good for
heart patients. One of the most common and severe diseases of
sunflower is rust caused by Puccinia helianthi.

Some recently developed cultivars have drooping heads. These
cultivars are less attractive to gardeners growing the flowers as
ornamental plants, but appeal to farmers, because they reduce bird
damage and losses from some plant diseases.

According to Central Statistics Agency 2019/20 report, the total area
under production was 7,560.56 hectares and the production was
estimated to be over 95,707.49 quintals.

 Group IV. Tubers, Roots and Vegetables

1. Irish potato (Solanum tuberosum)

The potato is one of mankind's most valuable food crops. In volume of
production it ranks fourth in the world after maize, rice, and wheat.
Among root crops, potato ranks first in volume produced and
consumed, followed by cassava, sweet potato, and yam. The relatively
high carbohydrate and low fat content of the potato makes it an
excellent energy source for human consumption. The tuber is known to
supply carbohydrate, high quality protein, and a substantial amount of
essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Potato is said to be
one of the most efficient crops in converting natural resources, labor,
and capital into a high quality food with wide consumer acceptance.

The cultivated potato belongs to the family Solanaceae; it is originated
in the high lands of South America and was first cultivated in the
vicinity of lake Titicaca near the border of Peru and Bolivia. It was
introduced to Ethiopia in 1858 and since then it has become an
important crop in many parts of the country. Ethiopia has suitable
edaphic and climatic conditions for the production of high quality ware
and seed potatoes. About 70% of the available agricultural land is
located at an altitude of 1800-2500 m.a.s.l and receives an annual rain
fall of more than 600 mm, which is suitable for potato production.
However, in 2019/20 Meher cropping season, the total area under
production reaches 70,362.22 hectares and the production is estimated
to be 9,245,283.61 quintals.

A number of production problems that account for the small area
cropped with potato and the low national yield have been identified.
The major ones are the concentration of potato cultivation in the
highlands, unavailability and high cost of seed tubers, non optimal
agronomic practices, the prevalence of diseases and insect pests, and
inadequate storage, transportation, and marketing facilities.

 7. Tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum.Mill)
Tomato is one of the most important and widely grown vegetable in
Ethiopia. Both the fresh, processing and cherry type is produced in the
country. Small-scale farmers produce the bulk of fresh market
tomatoes. Processing types are mainly produced in large-scale
horticultural farms. It is an important cash-generating crop to small-
scale farmers and provides employment in the production and
processing industries. It is also important source of vitamin A and C as
well as minerals. Farmers are interested in tomato production more
than any other vegetables for its multiple harvests potential of year
round production, which results in high profit per unit area. The fresh
produces is sliced and used as salad. It is also cooked for making local
sauce. The processed products such as tomato paste, tomato juice,
tomato ketchup and whole peel-tomato are produced for local market
and export. Recently tomato is recognized for treating various human
diseases. Such diverse uses make the tomato an important vegetable in
irrigated agriculture in the country and the production is also rapidly
increasing in many parts of the country.
Tomato is a seasonal climbing plant of the family Solanaceae. It is
grown as an annual and produced for its fruits. It is one of the most
popular & important vegetables for fresh consumption as well as for
processing.  The plant requires a warm & dry climate. The optimum
mean day temperature for growth of tomato lies between 21oC and
26oC and temperature above 32oC during fruit development inhibit the
formation of red color.

Tomato should be cultivated at an altitude below 2000 m. preferably;
soils for tomato cultivation are loamy sand to silt loam. The
requirement on the organic matter content of the soil is not so high, but
soils with medium organic matter (OM) content have better yields than
soils with a low OM content. Good soil drainage is important.
Optimum pH range is from 5.5 to 7.0. The first fruits are produced 80-
100 days from transplanting.

During 2019/20 Meher cropping season, the total area under production
reaches 6,012.28 ha and the production is estimated to be over
349,472.59 quintals.   _____________                                  Crop Variety Register

 9. Onion (Allium cepa L.)

Onion is one of the bulb crops belonging to the family Alliaceae. It is
an important bulb crop in Ethiopia. It is considerably important in the
daily Ethiopian diet. All the plant parts are edible, but the bulbs and the
lower stems sections are the most popular as seasonings or as
vegetables in stews. It is a recently introduced crop and rapidly
becoming popular among producers and consumers. It is widely
produced by small farmers and commercial growers throughout the
year for local use and export market. Onion is valued for its distinct
pungency and form essential ingredients for flavoring varieties of
dishes, sauces, soup, sandwiches, snacks as onion rings etc. It is
popular over the local shallot because of its high yield potential per unit
area, availability of desirable cultivars for various uses, ease of
propagation by seed, high domestic (bulb and seed) and export (bulb,
cut flowers) markets in fresh and processed forms.

Onion contributes substantially to the national economy, apart from
overcoming local demands. Products like bulbs and cut flowers are
exported to different countries of the world. With the growing irrigated
agriculture in the country, there is a great potential for extensive onion
seed and dry bulb production in the different production belts of the
country.

Onion prefers well-drained sandy loam with a high content of organic
matter. The optimum altitude range for Onion production is between
700 and 2200 m.a.s.l. and the optimum growing temperature lies
between 15o C and 23o C.

During 2019/20 Meher cropping season, the total area under production
reaches over 36,373.48 hectares and the production is estimated to be
over 2,738,589.86 quintals.

 33. Summer squash (Cucurbita pepo)
Summer squash (cucurbita pepo) is a recent introduction and
cultivation to Ethiopia. Summer squash, members of the Cucurbitaceae
family and relatives of both the melon and the cucumber, come in
many different varieties. While each type varies in shape, color, size
and flavor, they all share some common characteristics. The entire
vegetable, including its flesh, seeds and skin, is edible. In addition,
some varieties of the squashes produce edible flowers. Unlike winter
squash, summers squash is more fragile and cannot be stored for long
period of time.
Summer squash is a tender, warm-season vegetable that can be grown
easily in-home garden anytime during the warm, frost-free growing
season. It grows on bush-type plants that do not spread like the plants
of fall and winter squash and pumpkin. A few healthy and well-
maintained plants produce abundant yields.
Because summer squash develops very rapidly after pollination, they
are often picked when they are not too large and over mature. They
should be harvested when small and tender for best quality. Most
elongated varieties are picked when they are 2 inches or less in
diameter and 6 to 8 inches long.
Squash is used generally as a cooked food item, but is sometimes eaten
raw as a fresh salad ingredient. The fruit is usually harvested when it is
20 cm (8 in) or less in length while seeds are still soft and palatable. It
can be prepared in many ways, including boiled, baked, steamed, stir
fried or grilled.
Summer squash varieties neither released nor registered for production
in Ethiopia until 2020. However, seeds of the commercial „black
beauty‟ summer squash variety have been introduced and produced by
farmers with the recommendation of ministry of Agriculture since
1970s. However, the productions and consumptions of summer squash
have been increased in recent years around large cities due to
population increase and the demand of nutritional diversification.

 Group VIII. Industrial Crops

1. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum)
Cotton is a member of the genus Gossypium and belongs to the family
Malvaceae which also includes the flowering shrub Hibiscus and Okra.
The earliest cultivation of cotton is believed to have begun some 5,000
to 10,000 years ago in the regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. The
crop is now grown worldwide with greater concentration in the warmer
and hotter dry areas of the tropics/subtropics and temperate regions in
approximately 75 countries. Ethiopia is one of the centers of variability
and domestication of several cultivated plants, and it is probable that
cotton was also domesticated in this region.

Cotton has been produced in Ethiopia since very ancient times. Cotton
is one of the more valuable and extensively grown field crop plants in
the mild altitudes and lowland areas of Ethiopia. It has great
importance in the social, cultural and spiritual way of life of the people.
Both medium staple and short staple cottons are produced in the
country. It is used to manufacture a wide variety of of hand woven
dresses and industrial processed textile fabrics, in addition to edible oil
and protein rich-seedcake production for human and animal
consumption respectively.

Cotton is grown predominantly as a mono-crop, once in a year. The
main season, normally known as summer season, relies either on June
to September rainfall or on irrigation water that lasts, depending on the
locality, for about 126 days. The major cotton producing regions are
Amhara, Tigray, Afar, Gambella and South Nations Nationalities
people regions accounting for 96.8% of the total annual cotton
production.
Currently, cotton fiber is used for the manufacture of a wide variety of
textile products, yarns, cordages and other nonwoven products. Cotton
seed meal is generally used as animal feed and its cotton stalk is used
as feed, fuel wood and fencing material.  The cotton crop is a good
source of cash for the growers besides to its role as an export item in
the national economic development of the country. In addition, cotton
offers considerable employment opportunity on farms, industry, and
commercial trade, input and service sectors.

 plants are mechanically harvested by cutting the stalks of the plants.
Only fully mature leaves should be harvested when hand picking is
practices and harvests should be carried out at weekly intervals. After
harvest, leaves are usually tied in pairs to cure.

Tobacco is one the popular commercial plant grown by Ethiopian
farmers for local consumption and as industrial crop for international
market. Despite, tobacco growing is an ancient cultivated crop there is
no registered variety in the country based on the aforementioned fact,
